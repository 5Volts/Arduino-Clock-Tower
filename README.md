# Futuristic Clock Tower
Upload the sketch onto your Arduino Mega. If you connected the LEDs to different pin make sure you make changes to the sketch for the pin used.

Here are the links to [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-LED-Dual-Clock-Tower/) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JY76sLfSo4)
